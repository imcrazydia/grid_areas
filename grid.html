    <h1>10 Tips for your fanfic on wattpad</h1>
    <p class="tagline">these tips give a baseline of what to do.</p>
  </header>

  <section class="story-title">
    <h3 class="nummer">1</h3>
    <article>
      <h3>Your story title</h3>
      <p>The title is going to be one of your first impressions so it is important<br>
        that your title is catchy. It helps ensure that the book will stick in the<br>
        readers mind. It also has to be unique</p>
        <p>It should reflect on what is inside the book but also has to be quite<br>
          intriguing for the reader. This way it will create curiousity for the reader<br>
          and want them to read more. And reading more equals succes.</p>
          <p><b>Make sure that it isn't:</b>
          <br>+ Too long
          <br>+ Gives too much information
          <br>+ Looks like you didn't try at all</p>
    </article>

  <section class="book-cover">
    <h3 class="nummer">2</h3>
    <article>
      <h3>Book cover</h3>
      <p>It is one of the first impressions, so always make an effort with it. If you can't be asked to<br>
      make your own, there is always the BOOK COVER CLUB. Just find<br>
      someone there who can make it for you, there is always a talented<br>
      person there.</p>

  <section class="blurb">
    <h3 class="nummer">3</h3>
    <article>
      <h3>Blurb</h3>
      <p>The blurb is another one that you have to be carefull with. The blurb is<br>
      where you first show off your writing skills. So spelling and grammar are<br>
      important.</p>
      <p><b>It has to:</b>
      <br>+ Be informative, but not tell everything about the story
      <br>+ Keep the reader on his/her toes
      <br>+ Make the reader want to read more</p>
    </article>
  </section>

  <section class="spelling-grammar">
    <h3 class="nummer">4</h3>
    <article>
      <h3>Spelling and grammar</h3>
      <p>I don't know about you but I hate it when the story has spelling<br>
         mistakes. It puts me off reading. I think it's because if there are any<br>
         erros, it shows their carelessness.</p>
         <p>Do at least the spell check.</p>
         <p>Start if sentences sohuld be Capitalized. 'i's should be 'I's. And yeah the<br>
         basic but important stuff.</p>
    </article>
  </section>

  <section class="plot-line">
    <h3 class="nummer">5</h3>
    <article>
      <h3>Plot line</h3>
      <p>Have a unique plot. There LOADS of fanfics that are about a girl meeting<br>
      the boys then they fall in love, broke up in some sort then they fall back<br>
      in love again.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So yeah, keep your originality.</p>

  <section class="promote-it">
    <h3 class="nummer">6</h3>
    <article>
      <h3>Promote it</h3>
      <p>On wattpad you can join clubs to share your story. Do reads for<br>
      reads or just post a link to most clubs there. Also tell your favourite<br>
      writers to read it, and once they do and they comment, trust me you will<br>
      have confidence in yourself.</p>
    </article>

  <section class="chapter-activity">
    <h3 class="nummer">7</h3>
    <article>
      <h3>Chapters should always have something happening</h3>
      <p>Whether it's to describe the character more or describing a new setting,<br>
      something should ALWAYS happen. And it should always lead on to the next chapter.</p>
    </article>
  </section>

  <section class="talk-readers">
    <h3 class="nummer">8</h3>
    <article>
      <h3>Talk to your readers</h3>
      <p>Be nice to your readers. Always take time to thank them for supporting<br>
      you, this will gain your more fans and dedicated readers.</p>
      <p>But don't go overboard with it.</p>
    </article>
  </section>

  <section class="spacing">
    <h3 class="nummer">9</h3>
    <article>
      <h3>Spacing</h3>
      <p>Your story shouldn't have too much space in between the paragraphs and<br>
      no spacing at all is just as worse.</p>
    </article>
  </section>

  <section class="pride">
    <h3 class="nummer">10</h3>
    <article>
      <h3>Take pride in what you write</h3>
      <p>I really don't like it when readers out themselves down saying their<br>
      stories are 'bad' and that they don't have a chance to win. It makes<br>
      me feel really sad.</p>
      <p>That is one of the worst things that can happen when you're writing<br>
      hating your own story.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So hold your head up and WRITE.</p>
